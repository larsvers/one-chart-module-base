# Version 1

Just a simple API chart construction for the chart module. The data gets pulled in from a URL, there's an info object for conifgs and an api key.

More data prep to come, as well as more bindings config and surely state mutations.

For the country sheet also key will be the country highlight, which will require different custom settings for different chart types.

Also read one-data.md (not in this repo) for more points.

Challend will be to give the creator the right bindings and settings to control.
