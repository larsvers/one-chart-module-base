# Version 1

Just a simple Flourish Live API ('the API') chart construction for the chart module. The data gets pulled in from a URL (local for now), there's an info object for configs and an api key for the API.

More data prep to come, as well as more bindings config and surely state mutations.

For the country sheet key will be the country highlight, which will require different custom settings for different chart types.

Also read one-data.md (not in this repo) for more pointers...

A key challenge will be to give the creator the right bindings and settings depending on the chart template to control.
